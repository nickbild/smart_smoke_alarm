## Intro

Thousands of people die each year in fires in both residential and commercial settings.  Offices, warehouses, industrial, and manufacturing plants account for well over 1,000 fire-related injuries annually.  First responders work hard to rescue individuals that are either trapped in or incapacitated by a building fire, but without knowing where to look, they may not find them in time.

Smart Smoke Alarm attempts to solve this problem by providing firefighters with precise information about the locations of persons trapped inside a burning building.  This device uses a thermal camera and a machine learning classifier to identify people in the event that the smoke detector is tripped.  By using thermal imaging, it is possible to recognize people in the dark and through smoke.  Location information is wirelessly transmitted to a remote server where it could be viewed by first responders on the scene to help them focus their efforts.
